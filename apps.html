            <h2>React Native & Expo</h2>
            <p>In 2019, I started coaching a newbie developer on creating a mobile application. As the target users for
                this app are both Android and iOS device users, we decided to use React Native as well as the framework
                Expo. We also integrated Firebase to have persistent information across different users of the app.</p>

                A simple website that detects your location based on your current location or what you type into the

                displays some overlayed effects on a Google Streetview image of your location.</p>
