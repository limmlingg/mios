            <h2>The Apartment</h2>
            <p>The Apartment is an artgame that tests the boundaries between player and in-game character.
                <br>
                In this game, we follow a young girl coming home to her city apartment where she lives alone. While
                she's off doing normal things like showering and eating dinner, we are presented with an oddly
                naturalistic view of a game character's life.
                <br>
                This game was created in Unity. I programmed randomized walking (and collision detection) with scripted
                events for the main character, an inventory system for collecting items, and an ending cutscene that
                depends heavily on the items collected.

            <h2>Shift Happens</h2>
            <img src="images/shift-happens.jpg">
            <p>Shift Happens is an autoscroll runner game where zombies are on their way to get you! Using your special
                powers, you can create a time shift, where every zombie caught in your circle becomes old (and slower)
                or young (and faster). Use your powers to avoid as many zombies as possible!
                <br>
                Because the game had simple mechanics reminiscent of classic arcade games, I steered the art direction
                towards a retro pixel style. I created many of the main assets, including the title and ending screens
                and the character art.
                <br>
                Shift Happens won 2nd place on GameCraft 2017.

            <h2>MoonChaser</h2>
            <img src="images/moonchaser.jpg">
            <p>MoonChaser is a atmospheric platforming game of a cat racing towards the moon. This cat is able to land
                on either side of the platforms, and successfully switching sides earns extra points.
                <br>
                As the art and sound lead, I created the title screen and the main assets for the game. We went for a
                melancholic yet soothing vibe, with silhouettes to complement the minimalism of the game's mechanics.
                The rainfall effect was added to illustrate the movement in this autoscrolling game, as well as to add a
                pensive mood. The background tracks were also selected with these qualities in mind.
                <br>
                MoonChaser won 1st place on GameCraft 2016.
